## Credentials

| Environment Variable Name | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Managed by the AWS client. Access key ID (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_FILE` is not supported, use `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` instead) |
| `AWS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID` | Override the hosted zone ID. |
| `AWS_PROFILE` | Managed by the AWS client (`AWS_PROFILE_FILE` is not supported) |
| `AWS_REGION` | Managed by the AWS client (`AWS_REGION_FILE` is not supported) |
| `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` | Managed by the AWS client. Retrieve the region from the CLI config file (`AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG_FILE` is not supported) |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Managed by the AWS client. Secret access key (`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_FILE` is not supported, use `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` instead) |

The environment variable names can be suffixed by `_FILE` to reference a file instead of a value.
More information [here](/lego/dns/#configuration-and-credentials).


## Additional Configuration

| Environment Variable Name | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| `AWS_MAX_RETRIES` | The number of maximum returns the service will use to make an individual API request |
| `AWS_POLLING_INTERVAL` | Time between DNS propagation check |
| `AWS_PROPAGATION_TIMEOUT` | Maximum waiting time for DNS propagation |
| `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` | Managed by the AWS client. Shared credentials file. |
| `AWS_TTL` | The TTL of the TXT record used for the DNS challenge |

The environment variable names can be suffixed by `_FILE` to reference a file instead of a value.
More information [here](/lego/dns/#configuration-and-credentials).

## Description

AWS Credentials are automatically detected in the following locations and prioritized in the following order:

1. Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, [`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`]
2. Shared credentials file (defaults to `~/.aws/credentials`, profiles can be specified using `AWS_PROFILE`)
3. Amazon EC2 IAM role

The AWS Region is automatically detected in the following locations and prioritized in the following order:

1. Environment variables: `AWS_REGION`
2. Shared configuration file if `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` is set (defaults to `~/.aws/config`, profiles can be specified using `AWS_PROFILE`)

If `AWS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID` is not set, Lego tries to determine the correct public hosted zone via the FQDN.
