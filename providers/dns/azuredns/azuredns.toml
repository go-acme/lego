AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your service principal client secret> \
lego --domains example.com --email your_example@email.com --dns azuredns run

### Using client certificate

## Description

Azure Credentials are automatically detected in the following locations and prioritized in the following order:

1. Environment variables for client secret: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
2. Environment variables for client certificate: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH`
3. Workload identity for resources hosted in Azure environment (see below)
4. Shared credentials file (defaults to `~/.azure`), used by Azure CLI

### Workload identity

#### Azure Managed Identity

Azure managed identity service allows linking Azure AD identities to Azure resources. \
Workloads running inside compute typed resource can inherit from this configuration to get rights on Azure resources.

#### Workload identity for AKS

Workload identity allows workloads running Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) clusters to authenticate as an Azure AD application identity using federated credentials. \
This must be configured in kubernetes workload deployment in one hand and on the Azure AD application registration in the other hand. \

Here is a summary of the steps to follow to use it :
* create a `ServiceAccount` resource, add following annotations to reference the targeted Azure AD application registration : `azure.workload.identity/client-id` and `azure.workload.identity/tenant-id`. \
* on the `Deployment` resource you must reference the previous `ServiceAccount` and add the following label : `azure.workload.identity/use: "true"`.
* create a fedreated credentials of type `Kubernetes accessing Azure resources`, add the cluster issuer URL  and add the namespace and name of your kubernetes service account.
