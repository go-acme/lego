## Description

You may use `CF_API_EMAIL` and `CF_API_KEY` to authenticate, or `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN`, or `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN` and `CF_ZONE_API_TOKEN`.

### API keys

If using API keys (`CF_API_EMAIL` and `CF_API_KEY`), the Global API Key needs to be used, not the Origin CA Key.

Please be aware, that this in principle allows Lego to read and change *everything* related to this account.

### API tokens

With API tokens (`CF_DNS_API_TOKEN`, and optionally `CF_ZONE_API_TOKEN`),
very specific access can be granted to your resources at Cloudflare.
See this [Cloudflare announcement](https://blog.cloudflare.com/api-tokens-general-availability/) for details.

The main resources Lego cares for are the DNS entries for your Zones.
It also need to resolve a domain name to an internal Zone ID in order to manipulate DNS entries.

Hence, you should create an API token with the following permissions:

* Zone / Zone / Read
* Zone / DNS / Edit

You also need to scope the access to all your domains for this to work.
Then pass the API token as `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN` to Lego.

**Alternatively,** if you prefer a more strict set of privileges,
you can split the access tokens:

* Create one with *Zone / Zone / Read* permissions and scope it to all your zones.
  This is needed to resolve domain names to Zone IDs and can be shared among multiple Lego installations.
  Pass this API token as `CF_ZONE_API_TOKEN` to Lego.
* Create another API token with *Zone / DNS / Edit* permissions and set the scope to the domains you want to manage with a single Lego installation.
  Pass this token as `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN` to Lego.
* Repeat the previous step for each host you want to run Lego on.

This "paranoid" setup is mainly interesting for users who manage many zones/domains with a single Cloudflare account.
It follows the principle of least privilege and limits the possible damage, should one of the hosts become compromised.
