## Description

There are three main ways of authenticating with Designate:

1. The first one is by using the `OS_CLOUD` environment variable and a `clouds.yaml` file.
2. The second one is using your username and password, via the `OS_USERNAME`, `OS_PASSWORD` and `OS_PROJECT_NAME` environment variables.
3. The third one is by using an application credential, via the `OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_*` and `OS_USER_ID` environment variables.

For the username/password and application methods, the `OS_AUTH_URL` and `OS_REGION_NAME` environment variables are required.

For more information, you can read about the different methods of authentication with OpenStack in the Keystone's documentation and the gophercloud documentation:

- [Keystone username/password](https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/user/supported_clients.html)
- [Keystone application credentials](https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/user/application_credentials.html)

Public cloud providers with support for Designate:

- [Fuga Cloud](https://fuga.cloud/)
