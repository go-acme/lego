## Description

`DNSIMPLE_BASE_URL` is optional and must be set to production (https://api.dnsimple.com).
if `DNSIMPLE_BASE_URL` is not defined or empty, the production URL is used by default.

While you can manage DNS records in the [DNSimple Sandbox environment](https://developer.dnsimple.com/sandbox/),
DNS records will not resolve and you will not be able to satisfy the ACME DNS challenge.

To authenticate you need to provide a valid API token.
HTTP Basic Authentication is intentionally not supported.

### API tokens

You can [generate a new API token](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/api-access-token/) from your account page.
Only Account API tokens are supported, if you try to use an User API token you will receive an error message.
