Before using lego to request a certificate for a given domain or wildcard (such as `my.example.org` or `*.my.example.org`),
create a TXT record named `_acme-challenge.my.example.org`, and enable dynamic updates on it.
Generate a token for each URL with Hurricane Electric's UI, and copy it down.
Stick to alphanumeric tokens for greatest reliability.

To authenticate with the Hurricane Electric API,
add each record name/token pair you want to update to the `HURRICANE_TOKENS` environment variable, as shown in the examples.
Record names (without the `_acme-challenge.` component) and their tokens are separated with colons,
while the credential pairs are concatenated into a comma-separated list, like so:

```
HURRICANE_TOKENS=my.example.org:token1,demo.example.org:token2
```

If you are issuing both a wildcard certificate and a standard certificate for a given subdomain,
you should not have repeat entries for that name, as both will use the same credential.

```
HURRICANE_TOKENS=example.org:token
```
