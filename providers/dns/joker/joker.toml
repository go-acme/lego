As per [Joker.com documentation](https://joker.com/faq/content/6/496/en/let_s-encrypt-support.html):

> 1. please log in at Joker.com, visit 'My Domains',
>    find the domain you want to add  Let's Encrypt certificate for, and chose "DNS" in the menu
>
> 2. on the top right, you will find the setting for 'Dynamic DNS'.
>    If not already active, please activate it.
>    It will not affect any other already existing DNS records of this domain.
>
> 3. please take a note of the credentials which are now shown as 'Dynamic DNS Authentication', consisting of a 'username' and a 'password'.
>
> 4. this is all you have to do here - and only once per domain.
