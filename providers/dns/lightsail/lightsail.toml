## Description

AWS Credentials are automatically detected in the following locations and prioritized in the following order:

1. Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, [`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`]
2. Shared credentials file (defaults to `~/.aws/credentials`, profiles can be specified using `AWS_PROFILE`)
3. Amazon EC2 IAM role

AWS region is not required to set as the Lightsail DNS zone is in global (us-east-1) region.

## Policy

The following AWS IAM policy document describes the minimum permissions required for lego to complete the DNS challenge.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "lightsail:DeleteDomainEntry",
        "lightsail:CreateDomainEntry"
      ],
      "Resource": "<Lightsail DNS zone ARN>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace the `Resource` value with your Lightsail DNS zone ARN.
You can retrieve the ARN using aws cli by running `aws lightsail get-domains --region us-east-1` (Lightsail web console does not show the ARN, unfortunately).
It should be in the format of `arn:aws:lightsail:global:<ACCOUNT ID>:Domain/<DOMAIN ID>`.
You also need to replace the region in the ARN to `us-east-1` (instead of `global`).

Alternatively, you can also set the `Resource` to `*` (wildcard), which allow to access all domain, but this is not recommended.
