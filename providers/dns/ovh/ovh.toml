## Application Key and Secret

Application key and secret can be created by following the [OVH guide](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/first-steps-with-ovh-api/).

When requesting the consumer key, the following configuration can be use to define access rights:

```json
{
  "accessRules": [
    {
      "method": "POST",
      "path": "/domain/zone/*"
    },
    {
      "method": "DELETE",
      "path": "/domain/zone/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
