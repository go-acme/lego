## Application Key and Secret

Application key and secret can be created by following the [OVH guide](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/first-steps-with-ovh-api/).

When requesting the consumer key, the following configuration can be used to define access rights:

```json
{
  "accessRules": [
    {
      "method": "POST",
      "path": "/domain/zone/*"
    },
    {
      "method": "DELETE",
      "path": "/domain/zone/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## OAuth2 Client Credentials

Another method for authentication is by using OAuth2 client credentials.

An IAM policy and service account can be created by following the [OVH guide](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/en-manage-service-account?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0059343).

Following IAM policies need to be authorized for the affected domain:

* dnsZone:apiovh:record/create
* dnsZone:apiovh:record/delete
* dnsZone:apiovh:refresh

## Important Note

Both authentication methods cannot be used at the same time.
