## Description

AWS Credentials are automatically detected in the following locations and prioritized in the following order:

1. Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, [`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`]
2. Shared credentials file (defaults to `~/.aws/credentials`, profiles can be specified using `AWS_PROFILE`)
3. Amazon EC2 IAM role

The AWS Region is automatically detected in the following locations and prioritized in the following order:

1. Environment variables: `AWS_REGION`
2. Shared configuration file if `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` is set (defaults to `~/.aws/config`, profiles can be specified using `AWS_PROFILE`)

If `AWS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID` is not set, Lego tries to determine the correct public hosted zone via the FQDN.

## IAM Policy Examples

### Broad privileges for testing purposes

The following [IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) document grants access to the required APIs needed by lego to complete the DNS challenge.
A word of caution:
These permissions grant write access to any DNS record in any hosted zone,
so it is recommended to narrow them down as much as possible if you are using this policy in production.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "route53:GetChange",
        "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets",
        "route53:ListResourceRecordSets"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/*",
        "arn:aws:route53:::change/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "route53:ListHostedZonesByName",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Least privilege policy for production purposes

The following AWS IAM policy document describes the least privilege permissions required for lego to complete the DNS challenge.
Write access is limited to a specified hosted zone's DNS TXT records with a key of `_acme-challenge.example.com`.
Replace `Z11111112222222333333` with your hosted zone ID and `example.com` with your domain name to use this policy.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "route53:GetChange",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:route53:::change/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "route53:ListHostedZonesByName",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "route53:ListResourceRecordSets"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/Z11111112222222333333"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/Z11111112222222333333"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "ForAllValues:StringEquals": {
          "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSetsNormalizedRecordNames": [
            "_acme-challenge.example.com"
          ],
          "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSetsRecordTypes": [
            "TXT"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
