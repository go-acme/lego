## Description

AWS Credentials are automatically detected in the following locations and prioritized in the following order:

1. Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, [`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`]
2. Shared credentials file (defaults to `~/.aws/credentials`)
3. Amazon EC2 IAM role

If `AWS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID` is not set, Lego tries to determine the correct public hosted zone via the FQDN.

## Policy

The following AWS IAM policy document describes the permissions required for lego to complete the DNS challenge.
