## Description

AWS Credentials are automatically detected in the following locations and prioritized in the following order:

1. Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, [`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`]
2. Shared credentials file (defaults to `~/.aws/credentials`, profiles can be specified using `AWS_PROFILE`)
3. Amazon EC2 IAM role

The AWS Region is automatically detected in the following locations and prioritized in the following order:

1. Environment variables: `AWS_REGION`
2. Shared configuration file if `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` is set (defaults to `~/.aws/config`, profiles can be specified using `AWS_PROFILE`)

If `AWS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID` is not set, Lego tries to determine the correct public hosted zone via the FQDN.
