SelfHost.de doesn't have an API to create or delete TXT records,
there is only an "unofficial" and undocumented endpoint to update an existing TXT record.

So, before using lego to request a certificate for a given domain or wildcard (such as `my.example.org` or `*.my.example.org`),
you must create:

- one TXT record named `_acme-challenge.my.example.org` if you are **not** using wildcard for this domain.
- two TXT records named `_acme-challenge.my.example.org` if you are using wildcard for this domain.

After that you must edit the TXT record(s) to get the ID(s).

You then must prepare the `SELFHOSTDE_RECORDS_MAPPING` environment variable with the following format:

```
<domain_A>:<record_id_A1>:<record_id_A2>,<domain_B>:<record_id_B1>:<record_id_B2>,<domain_C>:<record_id_C1>:<record_id_C2>
```

where each group of domain + record ID(s) is separated with a comma (`,`),
and the domain and record ID(s) are separated with a colon (`:`).

For example, if you want to create or renew a certificate for `my.example.org`, `*.my.example.org`, and `other.example.org`,
you would need:

- two separate records for `_acme-challenge.my.example.org`
- and another separate record for `_acme-challenge.other.example.org`

The resulting environment variable would then be: `SELFHOSTDE_RECORDS_MAPPING=my.example.com:123:456,other.example.com:789`
