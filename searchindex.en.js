    "content": "This guide explains various ways to obtain a new certificate.\nUsing the built-in web server Open a terminal, and execute the following command (insert your own email address and domain):\nlego --email=\"you@example.com\" --domains=\"example.com\" --http run You will find your certificate in the .lego folder of the current working directory:\n$ ls -1 ./.lego/certificates example.com.crt example.com.issuer.crt example.com.json example.com.key [maybe more files for different domains...] where\nexample.com.crt is the server certificate (including the CA certificate), example.com.key is the private key needed for the server certificate, example.com.issuer.crt is the CA certificate, and example.com.json contains some JSON encoded meta information. For each domain, you will have a set of these four files. For wildcard certificates (*.example.com), the filenames will look like _.example.com.crt.\nThe .crt and .key files are PEM-encoded x509 certificates and private keys. If you’re looking for a cert.pem and privkey.pem, you can just use example.com.crt and example.com.key.\nUsing a DNS provider If you can’t or don’t want to start a web server, you need to use a DNS provider. lego comes with support for many providers, and you need to pick the one where your domain’s DNS settings are set up. Typically, this is the registrar where you bought the domain, but in some cases this can be another third-party provider.\nFor this example, let’s assume you have set up Gandi for your domain.\nExecute this command:\nGANDI_API_KEY=xxx \\ lego --email \"you@example.com\" --dns gandi --domains \"example.org\" --domains \"*.example.org\" run For a zone that has multiple SOAs This can often be found where your DNS provider has a zone entry for an internal network (i.e. a corporate network, or home LAN) as well as the public internet. In this case, point lego at an external authoritative server for the zone using the additional parameter --dns.resolvers.\nGANDI_API_KEY=xxx \\ lego --email \"you@example.com\" --dns gandi --dns.resolvers 9.9.9.9:53 --domains \"example.org\" --domains \"*.example.org\" run More information about resolvers.\nUsing a custom certificate signing request (CSR) The first step in the process of obtaining certificates involves creating a signing request. This CSR bundles various information, including the domain name(s) and a public key. By default, lego will hide this step from you, but if you already have a CSR, you can easily reuse it:\nlego --email=\"you@example.com\" --http --csr=\"/path/to/csr.pem\" run lego will infer the domains to be validated based on the contents of the CSR, so make sure the CSR’s Common Name and optional SubjectAltNames are set correctly.\nUsing an existing, running web server If you have an existing server running on port 80, the --http option also requires the --http.webroot option. This just writes the http-01 challenge token to the given directory in the folder .well-known/acme-challenge and does not start a server.\nThe given directory should be publicly served as / on the domain(s) for the validation to complete.\nIf the given directory is not publicly served you will have to support rewriting the request to the directory;\nYou could also implement a rewrite to rewrite .well-known/acme-challenge to the given directory .well-known/acme-challenge.\nYou should be able to run an existing webserver on port 80 and have lego write the token file with the HTTP-01 challenge key authorization to \u003cwebroot dir\u003e/.well-known/acme-challenge/ by running something like:\nlego --accept-tos --email you@example.com --http --http.webroot /path/to/webroot --domains example.com run Running a script afterward You can easily hook into the certificate-obtaining process by providing the path to a script:\nlego --email=\"you@example.com\" --domains=\"example.com\" --http run --run-hook=\"./myscript.sh\" Some information is provided through environment variables:\nLEGO_ACCOUNT_EMAIL: the email of the account. LEGO_CERT_DOMAIN: the main domain of the certificate. LEGO_CERT_PATH: the path of the certificate. LEGO_CERT_KEY_PATH: the path of the certificate key. LEGO_CERT_PEM_PATH: (only with --pem) the path to the PEM certificate. LEGO_CERT_PFX_PATH: (only with --pfx) the path to the PFX certificate. Use case A typical use case is distribute the certificate for other services and reload them if necessary. Since PEM-formatted TLS certificates are understood by many programs, it is relatively simple to use certificates for more than a web server.\nThis example script installs the new certificate for a mail server, and reloads it. Beware: this is just a starting point, error checking is omitted for brevity.\n#!/bin/bash # copy certificates to a directory controlled by Postfix postfix_cert_dir=\"/etc/postfix/certificates\" # our Postfix server only handles mail for @example.com domain if [ \"$LEGO_CERT_DOMAIN\" = \"example.com\" ]; then install -u postfix -g postfix -m 0644 \"$LEGO_CERT_PATH\" \"$postfix_cert_dir\" install -u postfix -g postfix -m 0640 \"$LEGO_CERT_KEY_PATH\" \"$postfix_cert_dir\" systemctl reload postfix@-service fi",

To avoid certificate errors, you need to ensure that you renew your certificate before it expires.\nIn order to renew a certificate, follow the general instructions laid out under Obtain a Certificate, and replace lego ... run with lego ... renew. Note that the renew sub-command supports a slightly different set of some command line flags.\nUsing the built-in web server By default, and following best practices, a certificate is only renewed if its expiry date is less than 30 days in the future.\nlego --email=\"you@example.com\" --domains=\"example.com\" --http renew If the certificate needs to renewed earlier, you can specify the number of remaining days:\nlego --email=\"you@example.com\" --domains=\"example.com\" --http renew --days 45 Using a DNS provider If you can’t or don’t want to start a web server, you need to use a DNS provider. lego comes with support for many providers, and you need to pick the one where your domain’s DNS settings are set up.

See Obtain a Certificate → Use case for an example script.\nAutomatic renewal It is tempting to create a cron job (or systemd timer) to automatically renew all you certificates.\nWhen doing so, please note that some cron defaults will cause measurable load on the ACME provider’s infrastructure. Notably @daily jobs run at midnight.\nTo both counteract load spikes (caused by all lego users) and reduce subsequent renewal failures, we were asked to implement a small random delay for non-interactive renewals.1 Since v4.8.0, lego will pause for up to 8 minutes to help spread the load.\nYou can help further, by adjusting your crontab entry, like so:\n# avoid: #@daily /usr/bin/lego ... renew #@midnight /usr/bin/lego ... renew #0 0 * * * /usr/bin/lego ... renew # instead, use a randomly chosen time: 35 3 * * * /usr/bin/lego ... renew If you use systemd timers, consider doing something similar, and/or introduce a RandomizedDelaySec:\n[Unit] Description=Renew certificates [Timer] Persistent=true # avoid: #OnCalendar=*-*-* 00:00:00 #OnCalendar=daily # instead, use a randomly chosen time: OnCalendar=*-*-* 3:35 # add extra delay, here up to 1 hour: RandomizedDelaySec=1h [Install] WantedBy=timers.target See GitHub issue #1656 for an excellent problem description. ↩︎",

If you’d like to test something without issuing real certificates, consider using the staging endpoint instead:\nlego --server=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory … Running without root privileges The CLI does not require root permissions but needs to bind to port 80 and 443 for certain challenges. To run the CLI without sudo, you have four options:\nUse setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /path/to/lego (Linux only) Pass the --http.port or/and the --tls.port option and specify a custom port to bind to. In this case you have to forward port 80/443 to these custom ports (see Port Usage). Pass the --http.webroot option and specify the path to your webroot folder. In this case the challenge will be written in a file in .well-known/acme-challenge/ inside your webroot. Pass the --dns option and specify a DNS provider. Port Usage By default, lego assumes it is able to bind to ports 80 and 443 to solve challenges. If this is not possible in your environment, you can use the --http.port and --tls.port options to instruct lego to listen on that interface:port for any incoming challenges.\nIf you are using either of these options, make sure you setup a proxy to redirect traffic to the chosen ports.\nHTTP Port: All plaintext HTTP requests to port 80 which begin with a request path of /.well-known/acme-challenge/ for the HTTP challenge1.\nTLS Port: All TLS handshakes on port 443 for the TLS-ALPN challenge.\nThis traffic redirection is only needed as long as lego solves challenges. As soon as you have received your certificates you can deactivate the forwarding.\nDNS Resolvers and Challenge Verification When using a DNS challenge provider (via --dns \u003cname\u003e), Lego tries to ensure the ACME challenge token is properly setup before instructing the ACME provider to perform the validation.\nThis involves a few DNS queries to different servers:\nDetermining the DNS zone and resolving CNAMEs.\nThe DNS zone for a given domain is determined by the SOA record, which contains the authoritative name server for the domain and all its subdomains. For simple domains like example.com, this is usually example.com itself. For other domains (like fra.eu.cdn.example.com), this can get complicated, as cdn.example.com may be delegated to the CDN provider, which means for cdn.example.com must exist a different SOA record.\nTo find the correct zone, Lego requests the SOA record for each DNS label (starting on the leaf domain, i.e. the left-most DNS label). If there is no SOA record, Lego requests the SOA record of the parent label, then for its parent, etc., until it reaches the apex domain2. Should any DNS label on the way be a CNAME, it is resolved as per usual.\nIn the default configuration, Lego uses the system name servers for this, and falls back to Google’s DNS servers, should they be absent.\nVerifying the challenge token.\nThe _acme-challenge.\u003cyourdomain\u003e TXT record must be correctly installed. Lego verifies this by directly querying the authoritative name server for this record (as detected in the previous step).\nStrictly speaking, this verification step is not necessary, but helps to protect your ACME account. Remember that some ACME providers impose a rate limit on certain actions (at the time of writing, Let’s Encrypt allows 300 new certificate orders per account per 3 hours).\nThere are also situations, where this verification step doesn’t work as expected:\nA “split DNS” setup gives different answers to clients on the internal network (Lego) vs. on the public internet (Let’s Encrypt). With “hidden master” setups, Lego may be able to directly talk to the primary DNS server, while the _acme-challenge record might not have fully propagated to the (public) secondary servers, yet. The effect is the same: Lego determined the challenge token to be installed correctly, while Let’s Encrypt has a different view, and rejects the certificate order.\nIn these cases, you can instruct Lego to use a different DNS resolver, using the --dns.resolvers flag. You should prefer one on the public internet, otherwise you might be susceptible to the same problem.\nOther options LEGO_CA_CERTIFICATES The environment variable LEGO_CA_CERTIFICATES allows to specify the path to PEM-encoded CA certificates that can be used to authenticate an ACME server with an HTTPS certificate not issued by a CA in the system-wide trusted root list.\nMultiple file paths can be added by using : (unix) or ; (Windows) as a separator.\nExample:\n# On Unix system LEGO_CA_CERTIFICATES=/foo/cert1.pem:/foo/cert2.pem LEGO_CA_SYSTEM_CERT_POOL The environment variable LEGO_CA_SYSTEM_CERT_POOL can be used to define if the certificates pool must use a copy of the system cert pool.\nExample:\nLEGO_CA_SYSTEM_CERT_POOL=true LEGO_CA_SERVER_NAME The environment variable LEGO_CA_SERVER_NAME allows to specify the CA server name used to authenticate an ACME server with an HTTPS certificate not issued by a CA in the system-wide trusted root list.\nExample:\nLEGO_CA_SERVER_NAME=foo LEGO_DISABLE_CNAME_SUPPORT By default, lego follows CNAME, the environment variable LEGO_DISABLE_CNAME_SUPPORT allows to disable this support.\nExample:\nLEGO_DISABLE_CNAME_SUPPORT=false LEGO_DEBUG_CLIENT_VERBOSE_ERROR The environment variable LEGO_DEBUG_CLIENT_VERBOSE_ERROR allows to enrich error messages from some of the DNS clients.\nExample:\nLEGO_DEBUG_CLIENT_VERBOSE_ERROR=true LEGO_DEBUG_DNS_API_HTTP_CLIENT ⚠️ WARNING: This will expose credentials in the log output! ⚠️\nDo not run this in production environments, or if you can’t be sure that logs aren’t accessed by third parties or tools (like log collectors).\nYou have been warned. Here be dragons.\nThe environment variable LEGO_DEBUG_DNS_API_HTTP_CLIENT allows debugging the DNS API interaction. It will dump the full request and response to the log output.\nSome DNS providers don’t support this option.\nExample:\nLEGO_DEBUG_DNS_API_HTTP_CLIENT=true LEGO_DEBUG_ACME_HTTP_CLIENT The environment variable LEGO_DEBUG_ACME_HTTP_CLIENT allows debug the calls to the ACME server.\nExample:\nLEGO_DEBUG_ACME_HTTP_CLIENT=true You must ensure that incoming validation requests contains the correct value for the HTTP Host header. If you operate lego behind a non-transparent reverse proxy (such as Apache or NGINX), you might need to alter the header field using --http.proxy-header X-Forwarded-Host. ↩︎\nThe apex domain is the domain you have registered with your domain registrar.

More information here.\nDescription Several authentication methods can be used to authenticate against Azure DNS API.\nDefault Azure Credentials (default option) Default Azure Credentials automatically detects in the following locations and prioritized in the following order:\nEnvironment variables for client secret: AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET Environment variables for client certificate: AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH Workload identity for resources hosted in Azure environment (see below) Shared credentials (defaults to ~/.azure folder), used by Azure CLI Link:\nAzure Authentication Environment variables Service Discovery Lego automatically finds all visible Azure (private) DNS zones using Azure ResourceGraph query. This can be limited by specifying environment variable AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID and/or AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP which limits the DNS zones to only a subscription or to one resourceGroup.\nAdditionally environment variable AZURE_SERVICEDISCOVERY_FILTER can be used to filter DNS zones with an addition Kusto filter eg:\nresources | where type =~ \"microsoft.network/dnszones\" | ${AZURE_SERVICEDISCOVERY_FILTER} | project subscriptionId, resourceGroup, name Client secret The Azure Credentials can be configured using the following environment variables:\nAZURE_CLIENT_ID = “Client ID” AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET = “Client secret” AZURE_TENANT_ID = “Tenant ID” This authentication method can be specifically used by setting the AZURE_AUTH_METHOD environment variable to env.\nClient certificate The Azure Credentials can be configured using the following environment variables:\nAZURE_CLIENT_ID = “Client ID” AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH = “Client certificate path” AZURE_TENANT_ID = “Tenant ID” This authentication method can be specifically used by setting the AZURE_AUTH_METHOD environment variable to env.\nWorkload identity Workload identity allows workloads running Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) clusters to authenticate as an Azure AD application identity using federated credentials.\nThis must be configured in kubernetes workload deployment in one hand and on the Azure AD application registration in the other hand.\nHere is a summary of the steps to follow to use it :\ncreate a ServiceAccount resource, add following annotations to reference the targeted Azure AD application registration : azure.workload.identity/client-id and azure.workload.identity/tenant-id. on the Deployment resource you must reference the previous ServiceAccount and add the following label : azure.workload.identity/use: \"true\". create a federated credentials of type Kubernetes accessing Azure resources, add the cluster issuer URL and add the namespace and name of your kubernetes service account. Link :\nAzure AD Workload identity This authentication method can be specifically used by setting the AZURE_AUTH_METHOD environment variable to wli.\nAzure Managed Identity Azure Managed Identity (with Azure workload) The Azure Managed Identity service allows linking Azure AD identities to Azure resources, without needing to manually manage client IDs and secrets.\nWorkloads with a Managed Identity can manage their own certificates, with permissions on specific domain names set using IAM assignments. For this to work, the Managed Identity requires the Reader role on the target DNS Zone, and the DNS Zone Contributor on the relevant _acme-challenge TXT records.\nFor example, to allow a Managed Identity to create a certificate for “fw01.lab.example.com”, using Azure CLI:\nexport AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=\"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\" export AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=\"rg1\" export SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID=\"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\" export AZURE_DNS_ZONE=\"lab.example.com\" export AZ_HOSTNAME=\"fw01\" export AZ_RECORD_SET=\"_acme-challenge.${AZ_HOSTNAME}\" az role assignment create \\ --assignee \"${SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID}\" \\ --role \"Reader\" \\ --scope \"/subscriptions/${AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.Network/dnszones/${AZURE_DNS_ZONE}\" az role assignment create \\ --assignee \"${SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID}\" \\ --role \"DNS Zone Contributor\" \\ --scope \"/subscriptions/${AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.Network/dnszones/${AZURE_DNS_ZONE}/TXT/${AZ_RECORD_SET}\" A timeout wrapper is configured for this authentication method. The duration can be configured by setting the AZURE_AUTH_MSI_TIMEOUT. The default timeout is 2 seconds. This authentication method can be specifically used by setting the AZURE_AUTH_METHOD environment variable to msi.\nAzure Managed Identity (with Azure Arc) The Azure Arc agent provides the ability to use a Managed Identity on resources hosted outside of Azure (such as on-prem virtual machines, or VMs in another cloud provider).\nWhile the upstream azidentity SDK will try to automatically identify and use the Azure Arc metadata service, if you get azuredns: DefaultAzureCredential: failed to acquire a token. error messages, you may need to set the environment variables:\nIMDS_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:40342 IDENTITY_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:40342/metadata/identity/oauth2/token A timeout wrapper is configured for this authentication method. The duration can be configured by setting the AZURE_AUTH_MSI_TIMEOUT. The default timeout is 2 seconds. This authentication method can be specifically used by setting the AZURE_AUTH_METHOD environment variable to msi.\nAzure CLI The Azure CLI is a command-line tool provided by Microsoft to interact with Azure resources. It provides an easy way to authenticate by simply running az login command. The generated token will be cached by default in the ~/.azure folder.\nThis authentication method can be specifically used by setting the AZURE_AUTH_METHOD environment variable to cli.\nOpen ID Connect Open ID Connect is a mechanism that establish a trust relationship between a running environment and the Azure AD identity provider. It can be enabled by setting the AZURE_AUTH_METHOD environment variable to oidc.\nAzure DevOps Pipelines It can be enabled by setting the AZURE_AUTH_METHOD environment variable to pipeline.\nMore information API documentation Go client",

See this Cloudflare announcement for details.\nThe main resources Lego cares for are the DNS entries for your Zones. It also needs to resolve a domain name to an internal Zone ID in order to manipulate DNS entries.\nHence, you should create an API token with the following permissions:\nZone / Zone / Read Zone / DNS / Edit You also need to scope the access to all your domains for this to work. Then pass the API token as CF_DNS_API_TOKEN to Lego.\nAlternatively, if you prefer a more strict set of privileges, you can split the access tokens:\nCreate one with Zone / Zone / Read permissions and scope it to all your zones or just the individual zone you need to edit. This is needed to resolve domain names to Zone IDs and can be shared among multiple Lego installations. Pass this API token as CF_ZONE_API_TOKEN to Lego. Create another API token with Zone / DNS / Edit permissions and set the scope to the domains you want to manage with a single Lego installation. Pass this token as CF_DNS_API_TOKEN to Lego. Repeat the previous step for each host you want to run Lego on. It is possible to use the same api token for both variables if it is given Zone:Read and DNS:Edit permission for the zone. This “paranoid” setup is mainly interesting for users who manage many zones/domains with a single Cloudflare account. It follows the principle of least privilege and limits the possible damage, should one of the hosts become compromised.\nMore information API documentation Go client",

Description The file name of the external program is specified in the environment variable EXEC_PATH.\nWhen it is run by lego, three command-line parameters are passed to it: The action (“present” or “cleanup”), the fully-qualified domain name and the value for the record.\nFor example, requesting a certificate for the domain ‘my.example.org’ can be achieved by calling lego as follows:\nEXEC_PATH=./update-dns.sh \\ lego --dns exec --d my.example.org run It will then call the program ‘./update-dns.sh’ with like this:\n./update-dns.sh \"present\" \"_acme-challenge.my.example.org.\" \"MsijOYZxqyjGnFGwhjrhfg-Xgbl5r68WPda0J9EgqqI\" The program then needs to make sure the record is inserted. When it returns an error via a non-zero exit code, lego aborts.\nWhen the record is to be removed again, the program is called with the first command-line parameter set to cleanup instead of present.\nIf you want to use the raw domain, token, and keyAuth values with your program, you can set EXEC_MODE=RAW:\nEXEC_MODE=RAW \\ EXEC_PATH=./update-dns.sh \\ lego --dns exec -d my.example.org run It will then call the program ./update-dns.sh like this:\n./update-dns.sh \"present\" \"--\" \"my.example.org.\" \"some-token\" \"KxAy-J3NwUmg9ZQuM-gP_Mq1nStaYSaP9tYQs5_-YsE.ksT-qywTd8058G-SHHWA3RAN72Pr0yWtPYmmY5UBpQ8\" Commands Note The -- is because the token MAY start with a -, and the called program may try and interpret a - as indicating a flag.

After that you must edit the TXT record(s) to get the ID(s).\nYou then must prepare the SELFHOSTDE_RECORDS_MAPPING environment variable with the following format:\n\u003cdomain_A\u003e:\u003crecord_id_A1\u003e:\u003crecord_id_A2\u003e,\u003cdomain_B\u003e:\u003crecord_id_B1\u003e:\u003crecord_id_B2\u003e,\u003cdomain_C\u003e:\u003crecord_id_C1\u003e:\u003crecord_id_C2\u003e where each group of domain + record ID(s) is separated with a comma (,), and the domain and record ID(s) are separated with a colon (:).\nFor example, if you want to create or renew a certificate for my.example.org, *.my.example.org, and other.example.org, you would need:\ntwo separate records for _acme-challenge.my.example.org and another separate record for _acme-challenge.other.example.org The resulting environment variable would then be: SELFHOSTDE_RECORDS_MAPPING=my.example.com:123:456,other.example.com:789",

    "content": "Lego can solve multiple ACME challenge types out of the box, but sometimes you have custom requirements.\nFor example, you may want to write a solver for the DNS-01 challenge that works with a different DNS provider (lego already supports CloudFlare, AWS, DigitalOcean, and others).\nThe DNS-01 challenge is advantageous when other challenge types are impossible. For example, the HTTP-01 challenge doesn’t work well behind a load balancer or CDN and the TLS-ALPN-01 challenge breaks behind TLS termination.\nBut even if using HTTP-01 or TLS-ALPN-01 challenges, you may have specific needs that lego does not consider by default.\nYou can write something called a challenge.Provider that implements this interface:\ntype Provider interface { Present(domain, token, keyAuth string) error CleanUp(domain, token, keyAuth string) error } This provides the means to solve a challenge. First you present a token to the ACME server in a way defined by the challenge type you’re solving for, then you “clean up” after the challenge finishes.\nWriting a challenge.Provider Pretend we want to write our own DNS-01 challenge provider (other challenge types have different requirements but the same principles apply).\nThis will let us prove ownership of domain names parked at a new, imaginary DNS service called BestDNS without having to start our own HTTP server. BestDNS has an API that, given an authentication token, allows us to manipulate DNS records.\nThis simplistic example has only one field to store the auth token, but in reality you may need to keep more state.\ntype DNSProviderBestDNS struct { apiAuthToken string } We should provide a constructor that returns a pointer to the struct. This is important in case we need to maintain state in the struct.\nfunc NewDNSProviderBestDNS(apiAuthToken string) (*DNSProviderBestDNS, error) { return \u0026DNSProviderBestDNS{apiAuthToken: apiAuthToken}, nil } Now we need to implement the interface. We’ll start with the Present method. You’ll be passed the domain name for which you’re proving ownership, a token, and a keyAuth string. How your provider uses token and keyAuth, or if you even use them at all, depends on the challenge type. For DNS-01, we’ll just use domain and keyAuth.\nfunc (d *DNSProviderBestDNS) Present(domain, token, keyAuth string) error { info := dns01.GetChallengeInfo(domain, keyAuth) // make API request to set a TXT record on fqdn with value and TTL return nil } After calling dns01.GetChallengeInfo(domain, keyAuth), we now have the information we need to make our API request and set the TXT record:\nFQDN is the fully qualified domain name on which to set the TXT record. EffectiveFQDN is the fully qualified domain name after the CNAMEs resolutions on which to set the TXT record. Value is the record’s value to set on the record. So then you make an API request to the DNS service according to their docs. Once the TXT record is set on the domain, you may return and the challenge will proceed.\nThe ACME server will then verify that you did what it required you to do, and once it is finished, lego will call your CleanUp method. In our case, we want to remove the TXT record we just created.\nfunc (d *DNSProviderBestDNS) CleanUp(domain, token, keyAuth string) error { // clean up any state you created in Present, like removing the TXT record } In our case, we’d just make another API request to have the DNS record deleted; no need to keep it and clutter the zone file.\nUsing your new challenge.Provider To use your new challenge provider, call client.Challenge.SetDNS01Provider to tell lego, “For this challenge, use this provider”. In our case:\nbestDNS, err := NewDNSProviderBestDNS(\"my-auth-token\") if err != nil { return err } client.Challenge.SetDNS01Provider(bestDNS) Then, when this client tries to solve the DNS-01 challenge, it will use our new provider, which sets TXT records on a domain name hosted by BestDNS.\nThat’s really all there is to it. Go make awesome things!",
