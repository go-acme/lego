	// a rule has an empty sequence of `cases`, it is always ignored during processing. When a rule has a
	// non-empty sequence of `cases`, its behavior during processing is configured by the first matching
	// `case` in the sequence. When a rule has no matching cases the rule is ignored. A rule case with no
	// `caseCondition` always matches. A rule case with a `caseCondition` matches only when that expression
	// evaluates to true for the given query.
